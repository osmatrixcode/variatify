AUTH PROBLEMS:
- apparently if problem with API ExtPay, will default to allow ALL users to have lifetime features. Make sure have periodic checks for auth
- for some reason, when sign in with already premium account, it asked for free trial and payment again? 
-when press login button in popup, will say sign up for trial or login. if already have an account and free trial again, need to pay again?

IMMEDIATE FIXES:
-when have popup open and song changes whilst popup is open, the song name in the popup doesnt update. 
-what happens when A purchases, and gives it to B and logs in to that? 
    *need to verify with email address when login for first time B? but still A can press yes confirm? 
    *this will stop mass sharing accounts, but doesnt prevent small sharing accounts (2 people)
